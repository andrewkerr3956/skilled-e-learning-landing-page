- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - CSS library

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I wanted to practice TailwindCSS because Bootstrap can be very limited sometimes.
This project mainly helped me practice and learn more about TailwindCSS.

### Continued development

Streamline how many classes are being used from TailwindCSS. If I kept adding more to some elements, they could become harder to maintain.

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS Documentation](https://www.example.com) - Helped me since I had trouble remembering some classes.
